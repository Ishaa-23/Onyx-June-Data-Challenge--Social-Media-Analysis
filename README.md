# Recommendations
* Prioritize video content across platforms especially YouTube as it drives ~90% more engagement. Allocate more resources to video production (both short-form and long-form).
* Invest in educational content, particularly for regions like USA, Canada, and Japan, where it has the highest reach. Tailor topics to local audience interests.
* Maintain a balanced content mix, but reduce reliance on sponsored posts where possible, or rethink sponsored content to make it feel more organic, given organic content performs better.
* Prioritize YouTube in the overall strategy, given its top performance on engagement, impressions, and views. Consider cross-promoting YouTube content on other platforms.
* Assess underperforming platforms and determine whether to reduce effort or modify tactics.
* Concentrate posting efforts between 10 AMâ€“12 PM and 2 PMâ€“6 PM, with a focus on Wednesdays and Saturdays for maximum impact.
* Front-load campaigns in Q1 (Januaryâ€“March) when engagement peaks, and plan for alternative tactics or promotions to sustain interest during the April dip.
* Customize best-posting weekday per region, since peak days vary - analyze and refine by country/region to optimize further.
* Consider localized educational campaigns in high-reach countries (USA, Canada, Japan) to deepen connection.
* Reevaluate sponsored content strategy â€” explore native ads, influencer collaborations, or branded content that mimics organic style, to capture the higher reach typically seen in organic posts.
